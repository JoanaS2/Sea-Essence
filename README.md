 ## Validator Testing
 ### W3C Validator 

 I have used the W3C validator to validate the HTML on both the Index page HTML and Thank You page HTML.

![Index Page HTML](documentation/w3cindex.png)
![Thank You Page HTML](documentation/w3cthankyou.png)

W3C validator was also used to validate the CSS in the style.css file

![style.css CSS](documentation/css_validator.png)
I acknowledged that the import URL for the Google font isn't working towards the end of my project submission. For future reference,  I know what I will need to do and identify that I should leave extra time during the last checks for validation errors due to working with styling and responsiveness.

---
### Lighthouse
I used Lighthouse in the Chrome Developer Tools which tests the performance, accessibility, best practices and SEO of the website.

## Solved Bugs 
- The footer on both pages was displayed in the middle of the screen causing the background image to shrink. It was found that the reason for this was because I was using too much padding.
- Textarea was overflowing out of the div section. The display set to none solved the issue.
- The navbar was losing its alignment when on smaller devices. My mentor suggested changing the margin and I also removed the height-align.


## Future Improvements
* Optimize page load times and implement efficient and more navigation to enhance user satisfaction.
* Expand on the destinations section and create a page by using javascript so users can find navigating destinations in more depth such as pricing and tour packages we offer.
* add custom 404 page
* I will improve the quality and quantity of commit messages in the future
