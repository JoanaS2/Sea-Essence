The color palette used is thought to stimulate and encourage relaxation.

â€¢ Different shades of blue are used to create a sense of harmony and tranquility, providing emphasis on nav links using the hover effect, illustrating the colors of the ocean.

* Sunglow yellow was used as a relatively brighter color to captivate attention.

The color palette was created using the [Coolors] (https://coolors.co/) website.
